Start writing **dev.to** articles with [TheActionDev-template](https://github.com/ful1e5/TheActionDev-template)

## Notice

### :warning: Deprecation of v1 and v2

**As of May 28, 2022, v1 and v2 has been fully sunset and no longer functions**

Due to the deprecation of the underlying utility functions, the TheActionDev GitHub Action
has released `v3` which will use the [js-yaml] library for parsing front-matter in articles.

I will be restricting any updates to the `v1` and `v2` Actions to security updates and hotfixes.

#### Migration from `v1` and `v2` to `v3`

The `v3` uploader has a few breaking changes for users

- Multiple tags have not been assigned as string with colon(,) or have been deprecated. Instead of use
  [YAML Array List] to assign it.

## What is TheActionDev?

**TheActionDev** is Github Action that allows you to write & upsert dev.to **articles**
without touching the `dev.to` UI. This action is initiated in **[ActionsHackathon]** and using **[forem API]**.
This action is scan your **Github Repository** based on `directory` [input](#inputs) and finds articles based
on the **[Jekyll front matter]** in `markdown` files.

## Basic Usage

- You'll first need to create a YAML file to describe the workflow in your project
  (e.g. .github/workflows/TheActionDev.yml).
- Generate dev.to `apiKey` by following
  [Forem API Docs](https://developers.forem.com/api/#section/Authentication/api_key)
- Add your `apiKey` to **GitHub Secret** by following
  [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)

### TheActionDev.yml

```yaml
name: TheActionDev Sync
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # your default branch

jobs:
  operations:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Sycing Article to dev.to
        uses: ful1e5/TheActionDev@v3
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.DEVTO_API_KEY }} # Store your 'api-key' in Github Secret
          directory: ./articles # Your article directory
          ignore: Development.md, Production.md # Markdown file you wan't to ignore. Multple files separated by ,(comma)
```

### Inputs

#### `api-key`

dev.to api key.

#### `directory`

Relative path to your articles(`*.md`) directory.

#### `ignore`

The file you want to ignore by this action. This **feature** is implemented by [@actions/glob],
So you also provide **[glob pattern]** with it. **Following files are ignored by default :**

- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- [Pull Request Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#pull-request-templates)
- [Issue Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#issue-templates)

For example, you want ignore all articles inside `foo` sub-directory, The `ignore` input look like this:

```diff
.....

 - name: Sycing Article to dev.to
   uses: ful1e5/TheActionDev@v3
   with:
     api-key: ${{ secrets.DEVTO_API_KEY }}
     directory: ./articles
-     ignore: foo/bar.md, foo/hello.md
+     ignore: foo/**.md

.....

```
